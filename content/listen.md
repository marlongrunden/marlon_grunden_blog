# City of Melbourne's Christmas festivals

![Christmas](/fed-square-xmas2.jpg)

Every year, the City of Melbourne put on a spectacular Christmas display across the entire City. I have been lucky enough over the last couple years to contribute music to this amazing celebration. Spanning classic orchestral all the way to an 80's inspired synth-infused Christmas adventure, the music composed for this project is never boring.

This project is also presented through a 24.2 speaker array inside the main Christmas tree. This allowed me to really play with the space and positioning of instruments so that no matter where you were standing around the tree, you were engulfed in music movement and excitement.
